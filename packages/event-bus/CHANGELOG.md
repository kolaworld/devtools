# @tanstack/devtools-event-bus

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- [#500](https://github.com/TanStack/devtools/pull/500) [`2df2e04`](https://github.com/TanStack/devtools/commit/2df2e04080cb5f8a46d11c0466ec4fc763095bc2) - Honor explicit client connection options when bundlers inject event bus defaults.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#466](https://github.com/TanStack/devtools/pull/466) [`73983a7`](https://github.com/TanStack/devtools/commit/73983a7d7e8eaa8800322f476130df3ed4329685) - Fix the plugin marketplace rendering empty ("No additional plugins available")
  when it should list installable plugins.
  - The client event bus no longer silently drops events emitted while its
    WebSocket is still connecting. Such events are now queued and flushed once
    the socket opens, so the marketplace's `mounted` request reliably reaches the
    server bus.
  - The marketplace now re-requests `package.json` every time it is opened and
    retries until the data arrives, so re-opening always re-fetches the plugin
    list.
  - Added TanStack AI Devtools (`@tanstack/react-ai-devtools`) to the plugin
    marketplace registry.
